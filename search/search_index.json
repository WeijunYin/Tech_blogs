Evaluation # We aim at addressing the forecasting ahead of 48 hours. Fore example, given at 6:00 A.M. today, it is required to effectively forecast the wind power generation beginning from 6:00 A.M. on this day to 5:50 AM on the day after tomorrow, given a series of historical records of the wind farm and the related wind turbines.
